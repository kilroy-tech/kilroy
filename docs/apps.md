# ![](images/kilroy.png ':size=64')  Kilroy Apps
Kilroy lets developers and users quickly create self-contained applications. Using Kilroy's drag-and-drop editors,
users can quickly design rich, interactive interfaces that can be powered by Kilroy's dozens of built-in functions,
or can be extended using standard Javascript.

Kilroy apps differ from traditional application executables in that they are almost exclusively made up of
structured JSON data objects. A fully featured Kilroy app can contain all of the user interface, server API
functions, HTML, images, and other media needed to create a Web2 or Web3 application.

Kilroy apps are completely self-contained in a digitally signed zip archive, which can be shared online through
the Kilroy App store.
